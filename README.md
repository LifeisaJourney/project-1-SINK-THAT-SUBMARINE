# project-1-SINK-THAT-SUBMARINE
An interactive JavaScript game of a submarine that you have to shoot down. This game comes with a twist! 
The first position of the submarine is given. Then, the submarine will move in one of the directions (horizontally or vertically by one). You will have to guess which one of those direction the submarine has moved to. Then, everytime you miss, the submarine can move again. The highest chance of winning is at the beginning, since it could range from 25% to 50% of getting it right on the first move. The submarine is on a 1x1 block.




### Rules
1) Starting Position of the submarine is given. Then it moves to one of the adjacent corners either horizontally or vertiaclly. 
2) No new tips will be given after the initial hint.
3) Once you have clicked onto the grid you will either HIT or MISS! You will miss more often than hit.
3) If you MISS, keep trying! The ship moves one block horizontally or vertically to a new location afterwards.
4) Refresh the game to play again!
